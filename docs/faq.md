## General

**Q: Who can participate in the competition?**  
A: The competition is open to students from universities and technical institutes from all over the world.

**Q: Can I participate as an individual, or do I need to be part of a team?**  
A: You can only participate as a team. Each team must have at least 2 members and a maximum of 5 members.

**Q: Do I need to have prior experience in robotics or programming to participate?**  
A: While experience with ROS might not be essential to get started, programming experience is necessary. You will need to be familiar with Python programming languages.

**Q: Is there a registration fee for the competition?**  
A: No, there is no registration fee for the competition.

## Simulation Phase

**Q: What software do I need for the simulation phase?**  
A: You will need to install ROS and Gazebo simulation environment.

**Q: Do I need to build a physical robot for the simulation phase?**  
A: No, you do not need to build a physical robot for the simulation phase. You will be using a virtual robot in a simulated environment.

**Q: Do I need to submit my source code for the simulation phase?**  
A: Yes, you need to submit your source code and a video of your simulation.

<!-- ## Physical Robot Phase

**Q: Can I use any robot for the physical robot phase?**  
A: No, you need to use the provided robot model for the competition.

**Q: Can I modify the robot hardware or software?**  
A: No, you can not modify the robot hardware or software. You are however required to provide software that interacts with the robot's interface to control the robot.

**Q: Do I need to submit my source code for the physical robot phase?**  
A: Yes, you need to submit your source code.

**Q: How do I test my robot for the physical robot phase?**  
A: You can test your robot in a simulated environment using ROS and Gazebo. Additionally, you can test your robot remotely in the field using methods you will be provided with. -->

## Submission

**Q: What do I need to submit for the competition?**  
A: For the simulation phase, you need to submit your source code, and a video of your robot in action. For the physical robot phase, you'll need to submit your source code, and a project report.

**Q: What file formats are allowed for submission?**  
A: You can submit your files in zip, tar, or tar.gz format.

## Judging

**Q: How will my entry be judged?**  
A: Your entry will be judged based on the task rubrics, the performance of your robot, and the overall presentation and documentation of work done.

**Q: Who will be judging the competition?**  
A: The competition will be judged by a panel of experts in robotics and computer science.

**Q: When will the winners be announced?**  
A: The winners will be announced on the competition's website and social media channels on the date specified in the [`Important Dates`](/documentation-2024/introduction/important-dates/) section.
