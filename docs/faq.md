A: You can only participate as a team. Each team must have at least 2 members and a maximum of 6 members.

**Q: Do I need to have prior experience in robotics or programming to participate?**  
A: While experience with ROS might not be essential to get started, programming experience is necessary. You will need to be familiar with Python programming languages.

**Q: How much is the registration fee and what does it cover?**  
A: There is no fee to participate in the Simulation Phase but there is a fee for the top teams that compete in Senegal. The $250 USD is a one-time payment per team that covers lodging, daily meals (breakfast, lunch and dinner), airport transportation and travel between the dormitory and competition arena.

**Q: What additional costs should teams cover?**
A: Teams must pay for their own passport and visa fees, travel to Senegal, and any optional items like custom team t-shirts or a national flag.

**Q: When is the payment due, and what happens if we miss the deadline?**
A: The fee is due by June 9, 2025. Teams that do not pay by the deadline will their final spot in the competition.


## Simulation Phase

**Q: What software do I need for the simulation phase?**  
A: You will need to install ROS and Gazebo simulation environment.

**Q: Do I need to build a physical robot for the simulation phase?**  
A: No, you do not need to build a physical robot for the simulation phase. You will be using a virtual robot in a simulated environment.

**Q: Do I need to submit my source code for the simulation phase?**  
A: Yes, you need to submit your source code and a video of your simulation.

<!-- ## Physical Robot Phase

**Q: Can I use any robot for the physical robot phase?**  
A: No, you need to use the provided robot model for the competition.

**Q: Can I modify the robot hardware or software?**  
A: No, you can not modify the robot hardware or software. You are however required to provide software that interacts with the robot's interface to control the robot.

**Q: Do I need to submit my source code for the physical robot phase?**  
A: Yes, you need to submit your source code.

**Q: How do I test my robot for the physical robot phase?**  
A: You can test your robot in a simulated environment using ROS and Gazebo. Additionally, you can test your robot remotely in the field using methods you will be provided with. -->

## Submission

**Q: What do I need to submit for the competition?**  
A: For the simulation phase, you need to submit your source code, and a video of your robot in action. For the physical robot phase, you'll need to submit your source code, and a project report.

**Q: What file formats are allowed for submission?**  
A: You can submit your files in zip, tar, or tar.gz format.

## Judging

**Q: How will my entry be judged?**  
A: Your entry will be judged based on the task rubrics, the performance of your robot, and the overall presentation and documentation of work done.

**Q: Who will be judging the competition?**  
A: The competition will be judged by a panel of experts in robotics and computer science.

**Q: When will the winners be announced?**  
A: The winners will be announced on the competition's website and social media channels on the date specified in the [`Important Dates`](/documentation-2025/introduction/important-dates/) section.
