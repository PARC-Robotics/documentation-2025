# Getting started with ROS

The [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org/about-ros/) (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

We have planned this competition around ROS because of its features as well as its widespread use in robotics research and industry. The version that will be used for this year's competition is **ROS 2 Jazzy** and utilizing Python. However, if your team is more familiar with C++, you can use that instead.

!!! note
    Your overall learning experience in this competition is **strongly dependent** on how much of the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 you can grasp early on. Hence, we **strongly recommend** that you put in the time to use these resources.

Next, let's look at how to setup your ROS 2 workspace for the competition.
