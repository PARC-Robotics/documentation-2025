# How to Submit

## Autonomy Track

Teams are expected to develop their solutions (ROS packages) in a 'solutions' folder inside the `~/ros2_ws/src` directory. You may have one or more ROS packages in this folder. 

This is the expected directory structure:

```
~/ros2_ws/src
.
├── parc_robot
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── package.xml
├── parc_robot_bringup
│   ├── .
│   ├── .
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── package.xml
├── parc_robot_description
│   ├── .
│   ├── .
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── package.xml
├── .
├── .
└── <YOUR_SOLUTION_FOLDER>        # Zip this folder and submit
    ├── <your_ros_package1>
    │   ├── .
    │   ├── .
    │   ├── setup.py
    │   └── package.xml
    ├── <your_ros_package2>
    │   ├── .
    │   ├── .
    │   ├── setup.py
    │   └── package.xml
    ├── .
    ├── .
    └── README.md                   # Required
```

1. Prepare a README.md file following this format and store in solution folder (see [example](https://github.com/PARC-Robotics/PARC2024-Engineers-League/blob/main/resources/sample-submission-readme.md)):
    * Introduction Section: Briefly describe your approach
    * Dependencies: List all the packages installed and used in your solution
    * Task 1 - 2 description and run command(s)
    * Challenges faced

2. Include all the packages (dependencies) used in your solution in your package's "package.xml" file ([see guide](https://docs.ros.org/en/jazzy/Tutorials/Intermediate/Rosdep.html){target=_blank})

3. Create simple short video demos of your solutions for Task 1 and 2. This can be done by taking a screen recording of your solution running in Gazebo. Please ensure the videos are less than 200 MB in size.

<!-- 4. Zip your solution folder and upload the folder and the videos on the [solution submission form](https://forms.gle/GwE7Tzm9FpYzUVQX9). -->
4. Zip your solution folder and upload the folder and the videos on the solution submission form (TO BE PROVIDED).
