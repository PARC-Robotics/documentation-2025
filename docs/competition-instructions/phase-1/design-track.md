# Design Track

## General Description

Applying fertilizers to crops enhance their nutrient intake, providing essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that are crucial for plant growth. By improving crop health and yield, fertilizers play a vital role in boosting agricultural productivity and contributing to global food security by ensuring a stable supply of food for an expanding population.

With precision agriculture in mind, teams are to design a fertilizer implement (a sprayer or spreader for instance) that can be integrated with the **PARC AgRobot**. The implement should be adaptable to different terrains and crop types. The solution should demonstrate the potential autonomous technology to transform agriculture and boost productivity.

## Design Specifications

* The implement should be light enough to be pulled by robot or mounted on its base. The **PARC AgRobot** is built using the AgileX Scout 2.0 ground robot and has a payload of **50 kg**. The robot specifications are available in the manual [here](https://indrorobotics.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/SCOUT2.0-USER-MANUAL-3.0.pdf){target=_blank}; the dimensions are at the end of the manual.

* The 3D model of the AgileX Scout 2.0 robot is available [here](https://github.com/PARC-Robotics/PARC2025-Engineers-League/blob/main/resources/SCOUT_v2.0.STEP){target=_blank}. Click on the **Download raw file** button to download the 3D model of Scout 2.0 in the **.STEP** format.

</p>

* The implement should be able to operate at the maximum speed of the robot which is **1.5 m/s**. 
  
* The implement can work passively using the robot's motion or using an electromechanical system which could involve sensors, actuators and/or motors.

## Design Guidelines

* Teams are to use CAD software --- like Fusion 360, SolidWorks, or FreeCAD --- to design the fertilizer implement.
* 3D renderings of the implement should be exported as a STEP file, that is, .stp, .step or .STEP
* Designs can be inspired by existing fertilizer machinery but optimized for precision and adaptability.

## Design Evaluation

The design track will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

| S/N      | Criteria/Metric | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------- |
| 1  | **3 View Drawings** | Provide 3 view drawings (or multiview drawings) of each part of the fertilizer implement with dimensional information. |
| 2  | **3D Renderings of Final Design** | Provide 3D renderings of the final implement design. |
| 3  | **Assembly Drawings** | 3D assembly of the fertilizer implement parts. |
| 4  | **Motion Simulation** | Simulation of the implement in motion. |
| 5  | **Bill of Materials** | List parts used for the assembly. |
| 6  | **Design Report**  | Document explaining the design approach, considerations made, implement components and its working principle. |
| 7  | **Ergonomics** | Considers user comfort and ease of operation. |
<!-- | 6  | **Structural integrity**  | Ensure the implement can withstand harsh conditions common in large fields. | -->
<!-- | 8  | **Scalability** | Determine if the design can be adapted for different field sizes.| -->

<!-- | 4 | **Cost-Effectiveness** | Shortest travel distance from robot (measured from robot center) through the crop rows to the goal which is calculated at the time limit [8 minutes] **(Smaller is better)** -->

<!-- Part of deliverables | 6  | **Design Report**  | Document explaining the design approach, components, implement working principle and considerations made. | -->


!!! note
    Teams that qualify for Real World Phase of the competition will have to present and demonstrate a prototype of their final design. Therefore, it is encouraged that teams
    also work on their prototypes during the Simulation phase.
